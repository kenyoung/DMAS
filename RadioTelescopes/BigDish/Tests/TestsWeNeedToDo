1) Measure the receiver temperature
   a) We should try to get some absorber material like ECCOSORBÂ® MCS
   b) Mount the ECCOSORB on wands that will allow us to block the receiver
   beam.
   c) Get dry ice to cool one of the ECCOSORB wands

2) Detect the Moon
   a) Once we know the receiver temperature is low enough, we can calculate
   whether or not we should be able to detect the Moon.

3) Measure the beam size
   a) Use a series of drift scans on the Moon to measure the beam, which
   will allow us to check that the optical alignment is at least roughtly
   correct.

4) Measure the illumination taper
   a) Use ECCOSORB to verify that the reciever illumination of the dish
   is uniform, with a sensible taper.
